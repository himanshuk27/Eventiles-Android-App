## Reflection 

This was a 3 week long project built during my second year in college. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.    

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into OAuth, Auth0, and two-factor authentication using Firebase or other third parties. Due to project time constraints, I had to table authentication and focus more on data from parts of the API that were restricted to authenticated users.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are Android, Firebase Auth, Firebase Push, AWS, MYSQL, PHP and a significant amount of Java and xml codes.
